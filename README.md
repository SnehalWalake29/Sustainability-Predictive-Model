# Sustainability-Predictive-Model
Energy efficiency and sustainability are important factors to address in the context of smart cities. In this sense, smart metering and nonintrusive load monitoring play a crucial role for fighting energy thefts and for optimizing the energy consumption of home, building and city.

## Predicting Future Energy Consumption and Assessing Sustainability Implications: An LSTM-RNN Approach for Accurate Forecasting Two Months Ahead
This project aims to develop a predictive model using LSTM-RNN architecture to forecast energy consumption levels two months into the future while considering sustainability implications. 

# Problem Statement:
Develop a model that accurately predicts future energy consumption levels, taking into account factors such as historical consumption patterns, environmental variables, socioeconomic indicators, and renewable energy integration, to assess sustainability implications.
